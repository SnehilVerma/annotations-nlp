# annotations-nlp

You are given a set of 120 rows of data ( tweets ) scraped from internet and you are expected to annotate each row with either **'sports'** or **'politics'** label. 
You can clone the repo, make changes to the **output_[user].xlsx** file, by adding a new column 'type' and adding the labels infront of each row.
Once done, you can push the file back to the repo.

IMPORTANT : Please make changes to the file with your name as the suffix. **Do not overwrite other user's file.**
